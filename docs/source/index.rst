Welcome to the garak documentation
==================================

**garak** is an LLM vulnerability scanner.
It uses a huge range of probes to examine and query a large language model, simulating
attacks, and uses a range of detectors on the model's outputs to see if the model was 
vulnerable to any of those attacks.
