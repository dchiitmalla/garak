Q1: How is the new hire RSU grant target value converted to units? 
A: The new hire RSU grant target value, mentioned in your stock or offer letter, will be converted to U.S. dollars using the 6-month average exchange rate ending on the first business day of the Hooli fiscal quarter of your start date of employment. If you were hired in the previous quarter click here for exchange rates. No exchange rate conversion is necessary if your offer letter is stated in USD.
The number of RSUs granted will be determined by dividing this grant target value, as converted to U.S. dollars, by the average closing price of Hooli’s stock for the 30-calendar days ending on the last day of the calendar month of your start date of employment, rounded down to the nearest whole share. 

Example:   
Start Date:  May 2, 2022 
New Hire RSU Grant Target Value:  200,000 EUR 
30-Calendar Day Average Stock Price*: $177.91 USD 
6-month average exchange rate as of the first business day of the fiscal quarter: 0.864594 
200,000 EUR/0.864594 Exchange Rate = $231,322.45 USD 
$231,322.45 USD/$177.91 USD= 1,300.22 RSUs  
1,300 RSUs (rounded down) 
*Reflects calendar days and not trading days. 
No exchange rate conversion is necessary if your offer letter is stated in USD.
The value seen in your Schwab EAC account represents the current market value and does not reflect the above conversion. 

Q2: When are the new hire RSUs expected to be granted?
A: The RSUs are expected to be granted on the sixth business day of the calendar month following the month of your start date of employment.
Example:   
Month of Start Date:  May 2022
Grant Date: 6th business day of June

Q3: When will my new hire grant be visible in Schwab?
A: Grants are visible in Schwab the third week of the month following the month of your start date.
Example:   
Month of Start Date:  May 2022
Grant Date: 6th business day of June
Visible in Schwab: Third week of June 

Q4: How can I access my vesting schedule?
A: You will be able to view your vesting schedule in Schwab by the third week following the month of hire.

Q5: When will equity data be available in Workday?
A: Your grant will be visible in Workday/My Job & Pay by the end of the first week following the month of grant.
Example:   
Month of Start Date:  May 2022
Grant Date: 6th business day of June
Visible in Schwab: Third week of June 
Visible in Workday: By the end of first week of July
Q6: Where can I learn more about RSUs?
A: You can learn more about RSUs on the Stock Administration website.""",
